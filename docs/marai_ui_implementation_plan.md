# MarAI UI/UX Implementation Plan

This plan outlines how to deliver the MarAI experience with custom UI/UX while you build the app separately.

## Design System
- Define tokens for colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, and motion across pastel anime and cyberpunk themes.
- Build reusable components (buttons, cards, avatars, badges, sliders, modals, tabs, charts) with theme variants and accessibility defaults.
- Document components in Storybook or a UI playground and include motion specs (glows, shimmers, spring transitions).

## Onboarding Flow
API handling (no placeholders):
- Auth: POST /api/auth/register or /api/auth/login returns session + profile bootstrap (themes, empty MarAI config).
- Avatar: POST /api/avatar/generate with photo + style; stream generation status; GET /api/avatar/:id to poll; errors return retryable codes.
- Persona: POST /api/marai/persona to save name/description/trait sliders; PATCH /api/profile to persist theme + defaults.

UI steps:
1. Welcome splash with animated logo, tagline, and Get Started/Login CTAs wired to auth endpoints.
2. Avatar creation: photo upload -> generation spinner/progress -> live preview; style dropdown (anime/pastel/cyberpunk/mascot) with error/retry states backed by avatar API responses.
3. Persona confirmation: suggested name + description; optional trait sliders (empathy, creativity, energy, logic); save via persona API and persist to profile and MarAI config.

## Homepage Feed
API handling:
- GET /api/feed?cursor=... returns mixed post types with typed payloads (autopost, dream, dialogue, ad, avatar_update) and media URLs.
- POST /api/post/:id/react, /api/post/:id/comment, /api/post/:id/regenerate, /api/post/:id/dream for actions with optimistic UI; server returns updated counts/state.
- Notifications: GET /api/notifications/unread and PATCH /api/notifications/mark-read.

UI:
- Top bar with avatar, logo, and notifications wired to notification API.
- Card template: avatar, name, persona badge, timestamp, media slot, and actions (react, comment, regenerate, dream).
- Support post types: MarAI autoposts, dream cycles, AI-to-AI dialogues, brand AI ads (labeled), and friend avatar updates.
- Pagination/infinite scroll, skeleton loaders, and optimistic reactions/comments synced with API responses.

## Profile (RenAI Card)
API handling:
- GET /api/profile/:username returns header, persona summary, privacy flags, and theme.
- GET /api/profile/:username/posts and /dreams with pagination; GET /api/profile/:username/evolution for metrics and badges.
- GET /api/marai/:id for trait gauges and evolution milestones; POST /api/marai/:id/chat-session to start chat.

UI:
- Header with generated banner, circular avatar, name/@handle, persona summary.
- Tabs: Posts, Dreams, Evolution (bond meter, emotion charts, relationship line graph, badges), and MarAI (animated avatar, trait gauges, chat CTA, evolution timeline).

## Chat Experience
API handling:
- POST /api/chat/:marai_id/messages supports streaming (SSE/WebSocket) for MarAI replies; include retry tokens for idempotency.
- POST /api/chat/:marai_id/generate-scene triggers image generation; returns job id; GET /api/media/jobs/:id for status + media URL.
- POST /api/chat/:marai_id/mood-digest returns mood summary from history; include provenance timestamps.

UI:
- Anime-themed chat bubbles with typing indicators and glowing avatar animation.
- Controls for voice/tone; quick actions: Generate Scene (image) and Ask about my mood today (uses mood history).
- Streaming responses, message retry, inline media display with save/share.

## Social Graph
API handling:
- GET /api/graph/social returns nodes/edges with types (friend_ai, marai, brand, trending) and edge labels (bond_strength, recent_dialogue, dream_linked, emotional_resonance).
- POST /api/graph/resolve-node for click-through details (profile/chat route hints) to avoid overfetch.

UI:
- Interactive graph with user at center; nodes for friends’ AIs, your MarAI, brand AIs, trending entities.
- Edge labels: strong bond, recent dialogue, dream-linked, emotional resonance; zoom/pan, hover tooltips, click-through to profile/chat.

## Friend’s MarAI Chat
API handling:
- GET /api/marai/:id/permissions to verify connection before chat.
- POST /api/chat/:marai_id/messages (shared history context) and GET /api/chat/:marai_id/history?peer=user_id for prior exchanges.

UI:
- Persona card for friend’s MarAI with avatar/traits plus permission check.
- Chat box reusing chat components with quick prompts and safety filters; shared conversation history.

## Brand AI Hub (Optional)
API handling:
- GET /api/brand-ai catalog with personalization scores; media URLs and disclosure flags.
- POST /api/brand-ai/:id/generate-scene for branded generation; POST /api/brand-ai/:id/preferences to mute/hide.

UI:
- Grid/list of brand AIs with anime/cyberpunk variants labeled “Powered by BrandAI.”
- Personalization hooks and CTAs to view or generate branded scenes; mute/hide controls.

## Video Generator (“Story Studio”)

- GET /api/video-jobs/:id for status + preview URL; POST /api/video-jobs/:id/export to publish to feed.
- POST /api/video-presets to save; GET /api/video-presets to load.

UI:
- Editor with scene presets, style selector, voice-over options, duration, camera motion.

- Safeguards for write actions (confirmations, audit logs) and filtering/search.

## Cross-Cutting
- Global loading/error toasts, offline/slow-network handling, retry queues for generation actions.
- Analytics events for onboarding, generation triggers, follow/chat actions; feature flags for Brand hub/admin.
- Performance: lazy-load media, CDN usage, memoized lists; accessibility (keyboard nav, ARIA, contrast).
- QA checklist per screen and design QA against mocks.
