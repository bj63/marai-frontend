   Creating an optimized production build ...
[@sentry/nextjs] It appears you've configured a `sentry.server.config.ts` file. Please ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js instrumentation hook instead. To ensure correct functionality of the SDK, `Sentry.init` must be called inside `instrumentation.ts`. Learn more about setting up an instrumentation hook in Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation. You can safely delete the `sentry.server.config.ts` file afterward.
warn  - It seems like you don't have a global error handler set up. It is recommended that you add a global-error.js file with Sentry instrumentation so that React rendering errors are reported to Sentry. Read more: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#react-render-errors-in-app-router (you can suppress this warning by setting SENTRY_SUPPRESS_GLOBAL_ERROR_HANDLER_FILE_WARNING=1 as environment variable)
[@sentry/nextjs] It appears you've configured a `sentry.edge.config.ts` file. Please ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js instrumentation hook instead. To ensure correct functionality of the SDK, `Sentry.init` must be called inside `instrumentation.ts`. Learn more about setting up an instrumentation hook in Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation. You can safely delete the `sentry.edge.config.ts` file afterward.
[@sentry/nextjs] The Sentry SDK has enabled source map generation for your Next.js app. If you don't want to serve Source Maps to your users, either set the `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` option to true, or manually delete the source maps after the build. In future Sentry SDK versions `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` will default to `true`. If you do not want to generate and upload sourcemaps, set the `sourcemaps.disable` option in `withSentryConfig()`.
